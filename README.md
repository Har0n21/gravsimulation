# gravsimulation
Simulation and Visualisation of n-body problem (gravitational force only, without collisions ) using Python.

This script can calculate and visualise evolution of n-body problem, by calculating gravitational forces between an arbitrary number of bodies and by using Velocity-Verlet numerical method for integration of Newton's equations of motion. The resulting visualisation is saved as .gif file in current directory. See 3body.py, 2body.py, cluster.py for examples.
